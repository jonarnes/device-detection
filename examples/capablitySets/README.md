#Sets of capabilities
You can define your own sets of multiple capabilities, including you own custom capabilities as well as standard WURFL capabilities.

You can define as many sets as you want. If you do not specify a set, or the set asked for is unrecognized, a default set will be returned. 

Sets are managed in the control panel at [whateverweb.com](http://whateverweb.com)

Here is the [JavaScript lib](https://github.com/whateverweb/device-detection/blob/master/examples/js/wew.js) talking to the service, but feel free to create your own.
